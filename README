# PRODIGY_DS_03 - Decision Tree Classifier (Bank Marketing Dataset)

## 📌 Task Objective

Build a *Decision Tree Classifier* to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their *demographic and behavioral data*.

## 🗂 Dataset Used

•⁠  ⁠*Dataset Name:* Bank Marketing Dataset  
•⁠  ⁠*Source:* UCI Machine Learning Repository  
•⁠  ⁠*File Used:* ⁠ bank.csv ⁠  
•⁠  ⁠*Target Variable:* ⁠ y ⁠ (whether a client has subscribed to a term deposit)  
•⁠  ⁠*Features include:*  
  - Age, job, marital status, education, contact method  
  - Number of calls, campaign outcomes  
  - Day, month, and more...

## 🔍 Steps Followed

1.⁠ ⁠*Data Loading and Inspection*
   - Loaded dataset using pandas
   - Checked structure and missing values

2.⁠ ⁠*Data Preprocessing*
   - Converted target variable (⁠ y ⁠) from ⁠ yes/no ⁠ to ⁠ 1/0 ⁠
   - One-hot encoded categorical features using ⁠ pd.get_dummies() ⁠

3.⁠ ⁠*Train/Test Split*
   - Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%)

4.⁠ ⁠*Model Training*
   - Used ⁠ DecisionTreeClassifier ⁠ from ⁠ sklearn ⁠
   - Trained the model on the training data

5.⁠ ⁠*Model Evaluation*
   - Evaluated using:
     - Accuracy Score
     - Confusion Matrix
     - Classification Report

6.⁠ ⁠*(Optional) Tree Visua*
